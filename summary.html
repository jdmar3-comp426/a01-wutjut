    <p class = "border">The Trojan War began when Paris, a Trojan prince, gave the golden apple to Aphrodite rather than Juno or Athena. In exchange, he gets the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen. 
        Paris steals Helen from Menalaeus, a Greek king. Menalaeus leads all the Greek city states to war against Troy. Juno and Athena are angry at Paris and support the Greeks against Troy. 
    The war lasts 10 years, and the Greeks cannot break through. They come up with a plan to hide in a big wooden horse. It works, they breach the city, pillage it, and burn it to the ground.
